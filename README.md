## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This is my first project using SASS, I wanted to give it a try so this project was a great opportunity to learn the fundamentals.

This project was also a great opportunity to learn more about CSS Grid when aligning the cards for desktop view.

### Useful resources

- [Sass in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akDIJa0AP5c) - This helped me understand the fundamentals of SASS.
- [Sass/SCSS for, each & while loops (Iteration Control) Tutorial](https://www.koderhq.com/tutorial/sass/iteration-control/) - This tutorial helped me with loops using SASS.
- [Learn CSS Grid - A 13 Minute Deep Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiNiSFIPIQE) - This video was super useful when learning about Grid concepts.
